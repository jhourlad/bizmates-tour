### Notes on design

The application follows the "mobile-first" design principle and all due efforts were made to make the layout adjust to the least-supported screen dimensions such a mobile devices with small displays.

Aside from being mobile-responsive, several consideration were also made to make sure that the layout stays "logical" and that it helps the user understand the information being coneyed to them. 
This includes, but not limited to, arrangement of content sections, font sizes, colors, spacings and systematic arrangment of content while retaining the overall aesthetic  quality of the pages.
